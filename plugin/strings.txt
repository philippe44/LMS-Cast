PLUGIN_CASTBRIDGE_ENCODEPARAMS_DESC
	EN	The bridge can either simply passthrough audio data to the player (with minor alteration) or do a full transcoding which
	EN	improves compatibility by sending controlled format and allows replay gain as well as fading in and out. It's also 
	EN	possible to send audio in a continuous flow of data instead of tracks one-bye-one to enable true gapless and 
	EN	cross-fading. See user's guide for more details
	EN	<br><i>- Transcode:</i> format sent to player. When left empty or set to 'none', audio is simply passed through to player
	EN	<br><i>- Flow:</i> enable "flow" mode where playlists are sent as a continuous audio stream.
	EN	<br><i>- Flac compression:</i> in flac mode, set the compression level. 0 = lowest compression & CPU load
	EN	<br><i>- MP3 bitrate:</i> in mp3 mode, set bitrate
	EN	<br><i>- Resample at:</i> resample rate for re-encoding. When "No higher" is set, resampling will only happen if rate is
	EN	above set value, except in flow mode where rate must be fixed (44100 by default). When left empty no resampling is done.
	EN	<br><i>- Sample size:</i> sample size for re-encoding. When left empty, original track sample size is used except in flow
